/**
 * =Code-block delimitation=
 * Scala 3 comes with new syntaxes to delimit code-blocks. Here, we will
 * first focus on function body, before taking a look the other
 * constructs.
 *
 * In terms of new syntax, for exemple, braces for the function body are
 * not necessary anymore, if the function has many lines. So, it is up
 * to you to add or not those braces.
 *
 * In the case, you do not add braces, the compiler becomes
 * indentation-sensitive â€” meaning that the indentation defines the
 * code-block. Python has the same functionality.
 *
 * You can also put an end marker to a function (like with Ruby) or use
 * braces back again. If you stay consistent in terms of code-block
 * delimitation, you can mix the different syntaxes.
 *
 * So, this is an example with braces.
